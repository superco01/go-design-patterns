Facade design pattern is part of the Gang of Four design patterns.
This pattern is under structural behavior category.

The concept of this pattern is to hide the complexity of sub-systems
by adding additional layers of abstaction. 

Example:
Let's say you have a car and want to start the engine. Basically you just need to 
press the Start button (facade) in your car and the engines under the hood (sub-systems) 
will get executed based on the order defined like fuel check, fuel injection, and ignition.
