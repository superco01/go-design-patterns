Strategy design pattern is part of the Gang of Four design patterns.
This pattern is under behavioral category.

Concept of strategy pattern is to select a behvior (algorithm) in a runtime.

Example:
You have use-case to be able to switch between sorting algorithm based 
on input from whether from an output of function to assess the data or from 
config. This input will then decide the sorting algoritm used in the 
runtime, means it will change the behaviour of our system that already live
